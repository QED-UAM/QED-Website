To read the articles or learn more, you can visit the <a href='/{{magazineUrl}}'>Magazine</a> section.<br><br>Other examples of activities we have organized include university tournaments of <strong>Mus and Chess</strong>, the <strong>Mathematical Carnival</strong>, and we have even participated in camps organized by the Department of Mathematics at UAM.",

Almost anything from daily life could inspire a new popular science article.<br><br>The <strong>scientific articles</strong> are aimed at students and professors of Mathematics, delving deeper into more complex concepts in this field. One of these articles might demonstrate the importance of a lesser-known theorem, while another might tackle a seemingly complex problem with a clever solution. The topics can be extremely varied, but all are more complex than those in the popular science section.<br><br>The magazine also includes <strong>interviews</strong>. These could be real interviews with important figures in current mathematics or fictional interviews with notable historical figures. Another interesting section is <strong>puzzles and problems</strong>. Here you'll find problems proposed by students and professors, guaranteed to provide some entertainment and a great sense of satisfaction when solved!",
